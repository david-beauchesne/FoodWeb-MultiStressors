# Proposal letter

 Dear Ecology Letters Editors,

 We wish to submit this proposal letter for you to consider the evaluation of a manuscript entitled On the sensitivity of food webs to multiple stressors, by David Beauchesne, Kevin Cazelles, Philippe Archambault, and Dominique Gravel, as an Ideas and Perspectives paper in Ecology Letters.

 Evaluating the effects of multiple stressors on biodiversity is becoming increasingly vital as global changes expand worldwide, yet our understanding of how stressors interact remains minimal after decades of research. Recent publications discuss the importance of species interactions for cumulative effects research (e.g. De Laender 2018, Global Change Biology; Bruder et al. 2019, Frontiers Environ. Science; Hodgson et al. 2019, Frontiers Ecol Evol; Orr et al. 2020, Proceeding Royal Soc), but the role of species interactions in mediating the effects of stressors has yet to be formally explored. We conceptualized and explored the effects of multiple stressors on food webs using 3-species motifs and uncovered that overlooking species interactions invariably underestimates the effects of stressors and that non-additive effects are prevalent in food webs. We applied the theory to a case study and found that apex predators and mesopredators from the Canadian St. Lawrence System are the most sensitive species to the cumulative effects of stressors. However, we show that a species susceptibility to stressors is not only species-specific, but also context-specific as it varies with food web structure and exposure to specific combinations of stressors. In conceptualizing the effects of multiple stressors on food webs, we bring theory closer to practice and show that considering the intricacies of ecological communities is key to properly assess the effects of stressors on species. This contribution is significant and timely because 1) it is the first exhaustive exploration of the non-additive effects of stressors on food webs, and 2) it provides a clear link between theory and management by illustrating how our framework can be applied to detect the most sensitive species in food webs exposed to various stressors. Our group is singularly positioned to write this paper. D. Beauchesne and P. Archambault both have strong backgrounds in environmental assessments in general and cumulative effects in particular. K. Cazelles and D. Gravel are both experts in food web modeling with strong backgrounds and recognition in the field.

 We hope that you will find the proposed manuscript suitable for evaluation in Ecology Letters.

 Sincrerely,

 David Beauchesne

 # Response

 Dear Dr Beauchesne,

Thank you for your proposal to Ecology Letters for an "Idea and Perspectives" paper. I think your concept is interesting and I would welcome a full manuscript submission. Please consider the following in preparing your manuscript.

- I&P articles are intended to introduce specific novel ideas to the ecology research community. Articles that are more discursive and reflective, reviews of existing knowledge, or simple reporting of an overlooked phenomenon are not acceptable. My reading of your proposal suggests that it has the potential to achieve our standard. However, your manuscript will need to establish the novelty, importance, and generality of your theory.
- Related, I&P submissions are most successful when they contain specific, testable predictions. This is my biggest concern about your proposed contribution, i.e. that your findings are so context dependent that they are not generally testable. Your manuscript should emphasize how your theory may be empirically tested. It is often helpful to name hypotheses, so that subsequent researchers may readily refer to them directly. Where possible, indicate what evidence there is in support or against the hypothesis. Evidence need not be strong as I&P articles are primarily about the idea, but what evidence there is (both for and against your theory) must be fairly treated.
- Please consider if there is some conceptual diagram that, together with its caption, summarizes your theory.

Please let Nathalie (cc'ed) know a date by which you anticipate submitting a manuscript so that we can include it into our planning. Additionally, when you submit your manuscript, please identify members of our editorial board who would be appropriate handling editors for this work. A full list of editors may be accessed online at https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/page/journal/14610248/homepage/editorialboard.html.

Please note that acceptance of a proposal in no way preempts the likely acceptance of a manuscript in that all manuscripts are subject to the journal's full evaluation procedures and it is often hard for us to judge a manuscript based on a short proposal. Of course we hope you are successful.

Sincerely yours,
John Drake, Senior Editor
