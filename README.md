<!-- [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/) -->



## Overview

This repo contains all the code to replicate the simulations, analyses and figures from our study on the sensitivity of food webs to the effects of multiple stressors.

## Code and figures

The code used to perform the simulations and analyses is located in `./Code/Analyses/`. All analyses were performed using [R version 4.1.0](https://www.r-project.org/) (2021-05-18), expect solving equation systems for motifs which was performed using [SageMath version 9.3](https://www.sagemath.org/). The code to generate figures is located in `./Code/Figures/` and the resulting figures are in `./Figures/`. The folder `./Code/Functions/` contains R functions used for the analyses and figures. Data and simulation results are located in `./Data/`.
