**Figure S2**. Trophic sensitivities ($S_m$) and amplifications ($A_m$) of species and function groups of the Northern Gulf of St. Lawrence in the mid-1980s [@morissette2003]. A species trophic sensitivity and amplification is summarized using the sum of simulated trophic sensitivities ($S_{i,G}$) and amplifications ($A_{i,G}$) to pathways of effect ($G$) across a species motif census ($M$). The left-hand side of the figure presents species and functional groups, unitary pathways of effects ($g$) arising from individual stressors and their potential effects on population level mortality, physiology and behaviour, and the motif census ($M$) of species and functional groups measured as the frequency of times they hold unique positions in tri-trophic food chain, omnivory, exploitative and apparent competition interactions structuring of the food web. Main stressors in the Northern Gulf of St. Lawrence were fisheries (\textit{i.e.} demersal destructive, demersal non-destructive high-bycatch and pelagic high-bycatch), climate change (\textit{i.e.} ocean acidification, hypoxia and bottom and surface temperature anomalies), and shipping [@beauchesne2020]. effects of stressors on individual ecological processes form unitary pathways of effect ($g$) that collectively affect food webs through integrative pathways of effect ($G$). The right-hand side of the figure presents trophic sensitivities and amplifications of species and functional groups. Negative trophic sensitivities denote species that are expected to be negatively affected by stressors, while positive trophic sensitivities identify species that may benefit from the effects of stressors based on their trophic position. Negative or positive trophic amplifications identify species or functional groups expected to be affected synergistically or antagonistically by stressors, respectively.
